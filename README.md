## Overview
This is a realtime face mask detection model based on Deep Learning coupled with Computer Vision which helps to identify whether a person is wearing a facemask or not.
Main aim of this project is to implement this in college or school or offices for monitoring who is following covid protocols.

Proposed Methodology:
We propose a two-stage architecture for detecting masked and unmasked faces and localizing them.
